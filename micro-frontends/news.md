# News system
The News system will have features such as:
### Displaying news
Display current news from external sources, related with meat production.
### Display news in detail 
Allow the users to read the news they selected in more detail.
### Statistics
Allow users to have access to statistics such as animal production, methane emissions, industrial racions use, chemical found in water bodies

News system should be a micro-frontend due to it's simplicity, the team will only focus in displaying the news and allowing user to read them in more detail after their selection, independent deployment, the news system cam be implemented without depending on other teams and micro-frontends.
