# Feedback system
The feedback system will have features such as:
### Give feedback
Allow users to give feedback about a product present in the app
### See feedback
Allow users to see other user's feedback about products on the app

The feedback system should be a micro-frontend system due to it's single responsability, this system's scope will be limited to the feedback from user's about certain products, simplicity, thsi micro-frontend system will only have two features both about giving and reading feedback, and reusability, if the feedback system needs to be implemented in other parts of the app this can be easily done with micro-frontend system already implemented.
