# Account management system
The account management system will have features such as:
### Edit account information
Allow user to change and see information about the account he is currently logged in such as his email, photo and password. 
### Settings
Allow user to access setting of the app and change them is he so desires
### Contact 
Contact someone from the app
### Log out

### Save products
Allow users to add products to their saved products area

THe account management system should be a micro-frontend system due to it's single responsability, every featuere of this micro-frontend will be related to the account management of the user, flexibility, if needed more features can be added or removed and team autonomy, the team responsible for this system is not dependent of any other teams working on the app.
