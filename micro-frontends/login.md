# Login system
The login system will have features such as:
### User authentication
This authentication is made trough email and password.
### Password recovery
Allows user to recover password.
### Registering new users
Allows new user to make an account in order to use the app.

The login system should be a micro-frontend due to it's reusability, if needed this login system can be reused implemented in other parts of the app, the ability to deploy it independently and work autonomously on the system, this way the team in charge of the login system will not be affected not affect other teams responsible for other micro-frontends and the single responsability of this micro-frontend will be on user account handling.
