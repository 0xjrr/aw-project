# Menu system
The menu system will have features such as:
### Home tab
Allows user to go to the homepage of the app
### Saved tab
Allows the user to see the saved meat products in his account
### News tab
Allows the user to see news about meat products from external sources
### Profile tab
Allows user to se personal information about the account that is currently logged in

The menu system should be a micro-frontend due to its single responsability, this system will allow user to navigate to different parts of the app, reusability, this system can be replicated in any needed part of the app, flexibility, the menu system can be reajusted or changed without affecting any other team and since it's a simple system changes won't be very demanding.
