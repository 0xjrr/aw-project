The product display system will have features such as:
### Highlight products
The most important products will be displayed such as more environment friendly meat, top evaluated by the users.
### Saved products display
The saved products will be displayed for the user currently logged in.
### All products from selected supermarket
The display of product according to the selected filter.
### Product description
Upon selecting a product, users can access detailed information about the products such as: Producer, origin, feeding regiment, age and race.
### Extra information table
UYser's can also expand on the details, this information is given trough a table containing information such as: profit and weight.

The product display should be a micro-frontend service due to it's flexibility, different products will be displayed according to different filters (saved, point of origin, importance) so flexibility is extremely important and reusability, since product display is present in different parts of the app being able to resuse this micro-frontend will increase performance in developement.
